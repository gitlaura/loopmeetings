				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px;"} What is Loop?
				%p Loop is a service that helps you meet interesting people who will be good additions to your professional network.
				%br
				We’ll set up a coffee or lunch meeting for you and other relevant professionals where you can get to know each other in a comfortable, small-group setting. We take care of logistics so you can enjoy your conversation.

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} Why should I join?
				%p Traditional networking can be awkward, intimidating, and a waste of time. We want to ensure that you meet good connections without the stress.
				%br Our small-group meetings help you get to know each person in your group, and we take care of the arrangements so you can concentrate on the conversation. Loop is a great way to meet people outside your workplace and current circles (if we do say so ourselves).

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} How does it work?
				%p You’ll join Loop by giving us some information about yourself including your LinkedIn profile and telling us what types of connections you’re interested in making. When we’ve matched you with relevant professionals, we will email you to check your availability, and arrange a time and place for you to meet with your group.

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} Will I know anything about the other professionals?

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} Where and when do meetings take place?
				%p Loop meetings take place at the time and place that’s most convenient for you and the other members we match with you. 8am coffee in the West Loop?  Done. 6pm in River North? You got it.

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} How much does it cost?
				%p It's free! At no cost to you, we screen all applicants for quality, match compatible professionals, and take care of logistics. All you have to do is show up.

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} What happens if I need to cancel?
				%p We ask your availability in advance in order to avoid scheduling issues and hope that you’ll make your Loop meeting a priority. However, if something unexpected comes up, please let us know as soon as possible.

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} Can I use my meeting to make a sale?
				%p Please don’t! We strongly discourage members from trying to make a sale during a Loop meeting. If you choose to develop relationships that lead to sales after your first meeting, that’s great – but Loop is not the time or place for closing a deal.

				%h1.bitter{style: "color: #003939; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"} I'm looking for a job. Is Loop for me?
				%p We understand that one of the primary goals of networking is to find new job opportunities, but we encourage members to be discreet. We want Loop to be an enjoyable, low-pressure experience for everyone, so please wait until after your meeting to reach out about transitional opportunities.
